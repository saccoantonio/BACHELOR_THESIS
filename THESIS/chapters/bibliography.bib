    abstract = {We investigated the complete thermodynamic cycle of aluminum nanoparticles through classical molecular dynamics simulations, spanning a wide size range from 200 atoms to 11000 atoms. The aluminum–aluminum interactions are modeled using a newly developed Bayesian Force Field (BFF) from the FLARE suite, a cutting-edge tool in our field. We discuss the database requirements to include melted nanodroplets to avoid unphysical behavior at the phase transition. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of structural stability up to sizes as large as 3 × 105 atoms. The developed Al-BFF predicts an icosahedral stability range up to 2000 atoms, ∼2nm, followed by a region of stability for decahedra, up to 25000 atoms. Beyond this size, the expected structure favors face-centered cubic shapes. At a fixed heating/cooling rate of 100 K/ns, we consistently observe a hysteresis loop, where the melting temperatures are higher than those associated with solidification. The annealing of a liquid droplet further stabilizes icosahedral structures, extending their stability range to 5000 atoms. Using a hierarchical k-means clustering, we find no evidence of surface melting but observe some mild indication of surface freezing. In any event, the liquid droplet’s surface shows local structural order at all sizes.},

ABSTRACT = {Machine learning interatomic potentials (ML-IAPs) and machine learning Hamiltonian (ML-Ham) have revolutionized atomistic and electronic structure simulations by offering near ab initio accuracy across extended time and length scales. In this Review, we summarize recent progress in these two fields, with emphasis on algorithmic and architectural innovations, geometric equivariance, data efficiency strategies, model-data co-design, and interpretable AI techniques. In addition, we discuss key challenges, including data fidelity, model generalizability, computational scalability, and explainability. Finally, we outline promising future directions, such as active learning, multi-fidelity frameworks, scalable message-passing architectures, and methods for enhancing interpretability, which is particularly crucial for the field of AI for Science (AI4S). The integration of these advances is expected to accelerate materials discovery and provide deeper mechanistic insights into complex material and physical systems.},

    abstract = {Rapid progress in the synthesis and processing of materials with structure on nanometer length scales has created a demand for greater scientific understanding of thermal transport in nanoscale devices, individual nanostructures, and nanostructured materials. This review emphasizes developments in experiment, theory, and computation that have occurred in the past ten years and summarizes the present status of the field. Interfaces between materials become increasingly important on small length scales. The thermal conductance of many solid–solid interfaces have been studied experimentally but the range of observed interface properties is much smaller than predicted by simple theory. Classical molecular dynamics simulations are emerging as a powerful tool for calculations of thermal conductance and phonon scattering, and may provide for a lively interplay of experiment and theory in the near term. Fundamental issues remain concerning the correct definitions of temperature in nonequilibrium nanoscale systems. Modern Si microelectronics are now firmly in the nanoscale regime—experiments have demonstrated that the close proximity of interfaces and the extremely small volume of heat dissipation strongly modifies thermal transport, thereby aggravating problems of thermal management. Microelectronic devices are too large to yield to atomic-level simulation in the foreseeable future and, therefore, calculations of thermal transport must rely on solutions of the Boltzmann transport equation; microscopic phonon scattering rates needed for predictive models are, even for Si, poorly known. Low-dimensional nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes, are predicted to have novel transport properties; the first quantitative experiments of the thermal conductivity of nanotubes have recently been achieved using microfabricated measurement systems. Nanoscale porosity decreases the permittivity of amorphous dielectrics but porosity also strongly decreases the thermal conductivity. The promise of improved thermoelectric materials and problems of thermal management of optoelectronic devices have stimulated extensive studies of semiconductor superlattices; agreement between experiment and theory is generally poor. Advances in measurement methods, e.g., the 3ω method, time-domain thermoreflectance, sources of coherent phonons, microfabricated test structures, and the scanning thermal microscope, are enabling new capabilities for nanoscale thermal metrology.},

abstract={In this work, the thermal and electrical transport in an individual silver nanowire is characterized down to 35 K for in-depth understanding of the strong structural defect induced electron scattering. The results indicate that, at room temperature, the electrical resistivity increases by around 4 folds from that of bulk silver. The Debye temperature (151 K) of the silver nanowire is found 36{\%} lower than that (235 K) of bulk silver, confirming strong phonon softening. At room temperature, the thermal conductivity is reduced by 55{\%} from that of bulk silver. This reduction becomes larger as the temperature goes down. To explain the opposite trends of thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) {\textasciitilde} temperature (T) of silver nanowire and bulk silver, a unified thermal resistivity () is used to elucidate the electron scattering mechanism. A large residual $\Theta$ is observed for silver nanowire while that of the bulk silver is almost zero. The same {\textasciitilde}T trend proposes that the silver nanowire and bulk silver share the similar phonon-electron scattering mechanism for thermal transport. Due to phonon-assisted electron energy transfer across grain boundaries, the Lorenz number of the silver nanowire is found much larger than that of bulk silver and decreases with decreasing temperature.},

    abstract = {Direct measurements are reported of the thermal conductivity (κ) for gold nanowires and nanoribbons fabricated on a support substrate. Two thickness values of 50 and 100 nm are investigated with lateral dimensions ranging from 74 to 720 nm, thereby spanning the nanowire to nanoribbon scales. Average polycrystalline grain sizes were 27 ± 5 nm for thickness 50 nm and 35 ± 4 nm for 100 nm thickness. Systematic decrease in κ is observed as film thickness is reduced and, for given thickness, as width decreases. At large lateral width studied here, corresponding to the microscale, κ values at room temperature are 280 and 200 W/m K for thicknesses of 100 and 50 nm, respectively. These are to be compared with the accepted value of κ = 317 W/m K for bulk gold. For the smallest case investigated, 50 nm in thickness and 74 nm in width, a value of κ = 56 W/m K is obtained. A small decrease is observed for κ when measured with ambient temperature 100 °C. The systematic dependence on width, for each thickness and both ambient temperatures studied, followed a simple exponential dependence with a characteristic length parameter of ∼150 nm. This length parameter exceeds the accepted electron mean-free path (∼40 nm), the grain sizes, and the film thicknesses. The decrease in κ with diminishing size was examined based on the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) methods. Agreement and limitations of the BTE are discussed.},

abstract = {Heat and matter currents are required to relax an out-of-equilibrium system with temperature and chemical potential gradients to thermodynamical equilibrium. The ratio of heat to particle conductance characterizes this response and takes a universal value for typical electronic materials, known as the Wiedemann–Franz law, originating in the quasi-particle nature of the excitations contributing to transport. Investigating the transport dynamics between two reservoirs of ultracold and strongly interacting Fermi gases, connected by a quantum point contact, we observe a nonequilibrium steady state, strongly violating the Wiedemann–Franz law. This cold atom version of the fountain effect, previously observed in superfluid helium superleaks, is characterized by a weak coupling between heat and particle currents that results in a nonvanishing Seebeck coefficient. We report on coupled heat and particle transport measurements through a quantum point contact (QPC) connecting two reservoirs of resonantly interacting, finite temperature Fermi gases. After heating one of them, we observe a particle current flowing from cold to hot. We monitor the temperature evolution of the reservoirs and find that the system evolves after an initial response into a nonequilibrium steady state with finite temperature and chemical potential differences across the QPC. In this state any relaxation in the form of heat and particle currents vanishes. From our measurements we extract the transport coefficients of the QPC and deduce a Lorenz number violating the Wiedemann–Franz law by one order of magnitude, a characteristic persisting even for a wide contact. In contrast, the Seebeck coefficient takes a value close to that expected for a noninteracting Fermi gas and shows a smooth decrease as the atom density close to the QPC is increased beyond the superfluid transition. Our work represents a fermionic analog of the fountain effect observed with superfluid helium and poses challenges for microscopic modeling of the finite temperature dynamics of the unitary Fermi gas.}}

Over the past two decades, ultrafast laser-based time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) has emerged and evolved as a reliable, powerful, and versatile technique to measure the thermal properties of a wide range of bulk and thin film materials and their interfaces. This tutorial discusses the basics as well as the recent advances of the TDTR technique and its applications in the thermal characterization of a variety of materials. The tutorial begins with the fundamentals of the TDTR technique, serving as a guideline for understanding the basic principles of this technique. Several variations of the TDTR technique that function similarly as the standard TDTR but with their own unique features are introduced, followed by introducing different advanced TDTR configurations that were developed to meet different measurement conditions. This tutorial closes with a summary that discusses the current limitations and proposes some directions for future development.},

abstract={Machine learned force fields typically require manual construction of training sets consisting of thousands of first principles calculations, which can result in low training efficiency and unpredictable errors when applied to structures not represented in the training set of the model. This severely limits the practical application of these models in systems with dynamics governed by important rare events, such as chemical reactions and diffusion. We present an adaptive Bayesian inference method for automating the training of interpretable, low-dimensional, and multi-element interatomic force fields using structures drawn on the fly from molecular dynamics simulations. Within an active learning framework, the internal uncertainty of a Gaussian process regression model is used to decide whether to accept the model prediction or to perform a first principles calculation to augment the training set of the model. The method is applied to a range of single- and multi-element systems and shown to achieve a favorable balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, while requiring a minimal amount of ab initio training data. We provide a fully open-source implementation of our method, as well as a procedure to map trained models to computationally efficient tabulated force fields.},

abstract  ="Molecular dynamics (MD) is a widely-used tool for simulating molecular and materials properties. It is common wisdom that molecular dynamics simulations should obey physical laws and{,} hence{,} lots of effort is put into ensuring that molecular dynamics simulations are energy conserving. The emergence of machine learning (ML) potentials for MD leads to a growing realization that monitoring conservation of energy during simulations is of low utility because the dynamics is often unphysically dissociative. Other ML methods for MD are not based on a potential and provide only forces or trajectories which are reasonable but not necessarily energy-conserving. Here we propose to clearly distinguish between the simulation-energy and true-energy conservation and highlight that the simulations should focus on decreasing the degree of true-energy non-conservation. We introduce very simple{,} new criteria for evaluating the quality of molecular dynamics by estimating the degree of true-energy non-conservation and we demonstrate their practical utility on an example of infrared spectra simulations. These criteria are more important and intuitive than simply evaluating the quality of the ML potential energies and forces as is commonly done and can be applied universally{,} e.g.{,} even for trajectories with unknown or discontinuous potential energy. Such an approach introduces new standards for evaluating MD by focusing on the true-energy conservation and can help in developing more accurate methods for simulating molecular and materials properties."}

abstract = {Lattice thermal conductivity (κ) is one of the most important thermoelectric parameters in determining the energy conversion efficiency of thermoelectric materials. However, thermal conductivity calculations are time-consuming in solving the Boltzmann transport equation or performing the molecular dynamic simulations. This paper reviews the first-principles Debye–Callaway approach, in which the Debye–Callaway model input parameters (i.e., the Debye temperature Θ, the phonon velocity v and the Grüneisen parameter γ) can be directly determined from the first-principles calculations of the vibrational properties of compounds within the quasiharmonic approximation. The first-principles Debye–Callaway approach for three experimentally well studied compounds (i.e., Cu3SbSe4, Cu3SbSe3 and SnSe) was proposed. The theoretically calculated κ using the approach is in agreement with the experimental value. Soft acoustic modes with low Θ and v but large γ have an effect on the determination of low lattice thermal conductivity thermoelectric materials. The first-principles Debye–Callaway approach has been proved as an effective tool to calculate κ without the experimental inputs. The results calculated by this approach can be used to predict the performance of low lattice thermal conductivity compounds.}

An electrochemical loading experiment provides a precise measure of the total hydrogen content of the sample.

abstract  ="In recent decades{,} problems with electromagnetic interference (EMI) radiation problems have arisen{,} that can seriously reduce the performance of precision devices nearby and threaten human health. In consequence{,} it is important to seek high efficiency materials to suppress EMI pollution. Generally{,} high magnetic permeability or electrical conductivity is essential for efficient EMI shielding. Conventionally{,} various forms of metal construction (sheet/films{,} coatings{,} etc.) are used for EMI shielding. However{,} metallic shielding has drawbacks that include high density{,} lack of corrosion resistance and expensive processing{,} which restrict its use in the modern electronic world. By contrast{,} conductive polymer composites (CPCs){,} formed from insulative polymers and conductive fillers{,} have attracted more and more interest from both industry and academia. CPCs have properties that offer great potential for application in efficient EMI shielding. These include low density{,} high flexibility{,} good chemical stability and easy processing and forming. From a theoretical viewpoint{,} it is generally accepted that the shielding of EM waves is due to the three basic mechanisms of reflection{,} absorption and multiple internal reflections. However{,} it must be recognized that the SE of CPCs has a close relation to the reflection mechanism{,} which can cause secondary EMI pollution. Therefore{,} materials with charge carriers or magnetic/electric dipoles as well as cellular structure should be the focus for the development of EMI shielding materials with strong absorption properties. On that basis{,} the main aim of this paper is to review the current position in research of the design of inorganic based foams (metal{,} carbon or MXene) and polymer composite foams as EMI shielding materials. On the one hand{,} these composite foams have the merit of being lightweight{,} and on the other hand{,} the special porous structure can effectively harvest microwaves by prolonging the travel path. As a result{,} absorption dominates EMI shielding{,} which satisfies current requirements of EMI shielding applications. This review also points out the future challenges and gives guidelines for finding solutions for the next generation of shielding applications using composite foams."}

abstract={Silver/copper-filament-based resistive switching memory relies on the formation and disruption of a metallic conductive filament (CF) with relatively large surface-to-volume ratio. The nanoscale CF can spontaneously break after formation, with a lifetime ranging from few microseconds to several months, or even years. Controlling and predicting the CF lifetime enables device engineering for a wide range of applications, such as non-volatile memory for data storage, tunable short/long term memory for synaptic neuromorphic computing, and fast selection devices for crosspoint arrays. However, conflictive explanations for the CF retention process are being proposed. Here we show that the CF lifetime can be described by a universal surface-limited self-diffusion mechanism of disruption of the metallic CF. The surface diffusion process provides a new perspective of ion transport mechanism at the nanoscale, explaining the broad range of reported lifetimes, and paving the way for material engineering of resistive switching device for memory and computing applications.},

ABSTRACT = {Glancing angle deposition (GLAD) is a unique physical vapor deposition technique to enable wafer-scale production of close-packed nanopillar arrays (NaPAs) made of a wide range of inorganic and organic materials and engineerable structures, offering great potential for advanced optoelectronic applications. By flexibly controlling substrate rotation during GLAD, this technique enables intricate sculpture of nanopillars in vertical/tilted column, helix, zigzag, and square spiral shapes or a combination of these shapes along the vertical growth axis. In particular, NaPAs exhibit unique engineerability in their material/structure-determined optical, electronic, chemical, mechanical, and morphological properties, making them versatile for significant applications in photovoltaics, photodetection, photocatalysis, and advanced displaying. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in optoelectronic applications of GLAD-fabricated NaPAs by exploring the relationship between structural features and device functionality. Additionally, we discuss the technical challenges associated with GLAD, such as scalability, material compatibility, and fabrication precision, and address prospects to produce next-generation optoelectronic devices.},

Remarkably, nanoporosity induced via sacrificial template significantly reduces the mass density of amorphous carbon to 0.66{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}0.82{\thinspace}g{\thinspace}cm−3 while the yield and fracture strengths of nanoporous carbon nanopillars are higher than those of most engineering materials with the similar mass density. Moreover, these nanopillars display both elastic and plastic behavior with large fracture strain. A reversible part of the sp2-to-sp3 transition produces large elastic strain and a high loss factor (up to 0.033) comparable to Ni-Ti shape memory alloys. The irreversible part of the sp2-to-sp3 transition enables plastic deformation, leading to a large fracture strain of up to 35{\%}. These findings are substantiated using simulation studies. None of the existing structural materials exhibit a comparable combination of mass density, strength, deformability, and damping capability. Hence, the results of this study illustrate the potential of both dense and nanoporous amorphous carbon materials as superior structural nanomaterials.},

abstract = {One-dimensional nanostructures are generally cited as nanowires, nanofibers, nanotubes, and so on. The foremost prominent feature of these materials is their electrical conductivity, which, unlike classical physics, doesn't increase their resistance because the diameter decreases. Numerous properties of these materials like electrical conductivity, optical, magnetic, biological, and environmental their sensory have created many applications for them altogether industries. nanowires (NWs) propose potential impact on electronics, computing, memory, data storage, communications, manufacturing, health, medicine, national security, and other economic sectors as well. NWs offer excellent surface-to-volume ratio (interface phenomena), low defect density, high optical output, and controllable n-type conductivity, making them more appropriate and sensitive for sensing applications. NWs with their ultra-sensitive and real-time detection capabilities lend their applications in nano biosensors, chemical sensors, gas sensors, and electrochemical sensors. NWs have been used in improving the optical absorption as well as for the collection efficacy in photovoltaic devices. NWs having small size, low weight, low cost for mass production, and are also compatible with commercial planar processes for large-scale circuitry. In the paper, the authors are focusing to summarize the recent advances in NWs with their potential applications in various fields such as research, health, security, education, entertainment, and power generation.}
