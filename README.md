# Bachelor Thesis Repository

This repository contains the material developed for my Bachelor’s thesis at Università degli Studi di Milano (UniMi), including simulation input files, data post-processing scripts, and the LaTeX sources of the written thesis and presentation.

The project focuses on atomistic simulations and thermal transport analysis using Molecular Dynamics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

### POST_PROCESSING
This folder contains Python scripts and notebooks used for:
- Data analysis and post-processing of Molecular Dynamics simulations
- Generation and manipulation of atomic configurations
- Calculation of physical observables
- Final production of results used in the thesis

---

### LAMMPS
This folder contains the main **LAMMPS input files** used to run the Molecular Dynamics simulations, including:
- Equilibration protocols
- Production runs
- Green–Kubo thermal conductivity calculations

---

### THESIS
LaTeX source files of the full written thesis, including:
- Main document
- Figures
- Bibliography
- Custom macros and formatting files

---

### SUMMARY
LaTeX source files for the thesis summary/abstract.

---

### PRESENTATION
PDF files of the slides used for the thesis defense.

---

## Notes

- The repository is structured to ensure **reproducibility** of the simulations and analysis.
- Some paths inside input files may need to be adapted depending on the local system configuration.
- Large raw simulation outputs are not included.
